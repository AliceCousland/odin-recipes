            <h2> <em> Ingredients </em> </h2>
            <ul> 
                <li> 1½ teaspoons butter </li>
                <li> 1¼ teaspoons olive oil </li>
                <li> ½ pound portobello mushrooms, chopped </li>
                <li> ¼ cup chopped onion </li>
                <li> ¼ cup chopped carrot </li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons chopped celery </li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons white wine </li>
                <li> ½ cup beef broth </li>
                <li> 1¼ teaspoons tomato paste </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon butter </li>
                <li> 2 ounces enoki mushrooms </li>
                <li> 3½ tablespoons heavy cream </li>
                <li> 1 pinch ground nutmeg </li>
                <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> <em> Steps </em> </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Melt 1 1/2 teaspoon of butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the portobello mushrooms, onion, carrot, and celery until the vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Transfer the mushroom mixture to a large saucepan. </li>
                <li> Pour the white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil, dissolving any browned flavor bits from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the wine to cook for about 2 minutes, until reduced, and pour into the saucepan. Stir the beef broth and tomato paste into the mixture in the saucepan, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low. Simmer, partially covered, until the beef broth has reduced and the vegetables are very tender, about 35 minutes. </li>
                <li> Melt 1 teaspoon of butter in the original skillet, and cook and stir the enoki mushrooms until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the enoki, and chop. Stir the chopped enoki mushrooms into the sauce and simmer for about 10 minutes; stir in the heavy cream, and allow to heat through (do not boil). Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste. </li>
            </ol>
